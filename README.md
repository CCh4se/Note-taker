# Challenge-11-Note-Taker

## Description
We were tasked with adding to the starter code to create a functional Note Taker that can save and write notes on the backend. This was done by installing the dependencies and finishing the routes folder for the html and api routes. This was done to complete the acceptance criteria for the user. These included being presented with a landing page with a link to the notes page, the save icon will appear in the navigation, and being presented with empty fields to enter a new note.title and the note's text in the right column.
